Lockdowns, travel bans, and social distancing have brought global economic activities to a near standstill. Host countries face additional challenges in many sectors, such as health and agriculture, that depend on the availability of migrant workers. Migrants face the risk of contagion and also the possible loss of employment, wages, and health insurance coverage. This Migration and Development Brief provides a prognosis of how these events might affect global trends in international economic migration and remittances in 2020 and 2021. Considering that migrants tend to be concentrated in urban economic centers (cities), and are vulnerable to infection by the coronavirus, there is a need to include migrants in efforts to fight thecoronavirus. Migrant remittances provide an economic lifeline to poor households in many countries; a reduction in remittance flows could increase poverty and reduce households’ access to much‐needed health services. The crisis could exacerbate xenophobic, discriminatory treatment of migrants, which calls for greater vigilance against such practices. This Brief is largely focused on international migrants, but governments should not ignore the plight of internal migrants. The magnitude of internal migration is about two‐and‐a‐half times that of international migration. Lockdowns, loss of employment, and social distancing prompted a chaotic and painful process of mass return for internal migrants in India and many countries in Latin America. Thus, the COVID‐19 containment measures might have contributed to spreading the epidemic.

Lockdowns,\\ntravel bans, and social distancing have brought\\nglobal economic activities to a near standstill.\\nHost countries face additional challenges in\\nmany sectors, such as health and agriculture,\\nthat depend on the availability of migrant\\nworkers. Migrants face the risk of contagion\\nand also the possible loss of employment,\\nwages, and health insurance coverage. This\\nMigration and Development Brief provides\\n\\na prognosis of how these events might affect\\nglobal trends in international economic migra-\\ntion and remittances in 2020 and 2021.\\n\\nConsidering that migrants tend to be concen-\\ntrated in urban economic centers (cities), and\\nare vulnerable to infection by the coronavirus,\\nthere is a need to include migrants in efforts to\\nfight the coronavirus. Migrant remittances pro-\\nvide an economic lifeline to poor households in\\nmany countries; a reduction in remittance flows\\ncould increase poverty and reduce households’\\naccess to much-needed health services. The\\ncrisis could exacerbate xenophobic, discrimi-\\nnatory treatment of migrants, which calls for\\ngreater vigilance against such practices.\\n\\nThis Brief is largely focused on international\\nmigrants, but governments should not ignore\\nthe plight of internal migrants. The magnitude\\nof internal migration is about two-and-a-half\\ntimes that of international migration. Lock-\\ndowns, loss of employment, and social distanc-\\ning prompted a chaotic and painful process\\n\\nof mass return for internal migrants in India\\nand many countries in Latin America. Thus,\\nthe COVID-19 containment measures might\\n\\nviii\\n\\nhave contributed to spreading the epidemic.\\nGovernments need to address the challenges\\nfacing internal migrants by including them in\\nhealth services and cash transfer and other\\nsocial programs, and protecting them from\\ndiscrimination.\\n\\nMigration flows are likely to fall, but the stock\\nof international migrants may not decrease im-\\nmediately, since migrants cannot return to their\\ncountries due to travel bans and disruption to\\ntransportation services. Migrant workers tend\\nto be vulnerable to the loss of employment and\\nwages during an economic crisis in their host\\ncountry, more so than native-born workers.\\nLockdowns in labor camps and dormitories\\ncan also increase the risk of contagion among\\nmigrant workers. Many migrants have been\\nstranded due to the suspension of transport\\nservices. Some host countries have granted\\nvisa extensions and temporary amnesty to mi-\\ngrant workers, and some have suspended the\\ninvoluntary return of migrants.\\n\\nIn 2020, remittance flows to low- and mid-\\ndle-income countries are expected to drop\\n\\nby around 20 percent to $445 billion, from\\n$554 billion in 2019. In the midst of this sharp\\ndecline, the relative importance of remittance\\nflows as a source of external financing for low-\\nand middle-income countries is expected to\\nrise. This is because foreign direct investment is\\nexpected to decline by even more, due to travel\\nbans, disruption of international trade, and\\nwealth effects of declines in the stock prices of\\nmultinational companies. This Brief estimates\\nthat it could fall by more than 35 percent.\\nPrivate portfolio flows through stock and bond\\nmarkets could fall by over 80 percent.\\n\\x0cCOVID-19 Crisis Through a Migration Lens\\n\\nThe global average cost of remittances de-\\nclined to 6.8 percent in the first quarter of\\n2020, from 6.9 percent a year previous. This re-\\nmains far above the Sustainable Development\\nGoal target of 3 percent. Remittance service\\nproviders have been affected by lockdowns,\\nshorter business hours, and social distancing.\\nThis has increased the relative importance of\\nelectronic transfers, since some cash-based\\nservices and remittance operators have been\\nclosed or impacted negatively by the crisis. Al-\\nthough the use of digital payment instruments\\nfor sending remittances is increasing, poorer\\nand irregular migrants often lack access to on-\\nline services. They require the origination and\\ndistribution of funds through banks, payment\\ncards, or mobile money. Online transactions\\n(like cash-based services) require remittance\\nservice providers to exercise vigilance against\\nfraud and financial crime, to comply with\\nanti-money laundering and countering the\\nfinancing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations.\\nHowever, such due diligence has become diffi-\\ncult amid staff shortages.\\n\\nSo far, government policy responses to the\\nCOVID-19 crisis have largely excluded mi-\\ngrants and their families back home. But there\\nis a strong case for including migrants in the\\nnear-term health strategies of all countries,\\ngiven the externalities associated with the\\nhealth status of an entire population in the face\\nof a highly contagious pandemic. Also, govern-\\nments would do well to consider short-, medi-\\num-, and long-term interventions to support: (i)\\nstranded migrants; (ii) the remittance infra-\\nstructure; (iii) loss of subsistence income for\\nfamilies back home; and (iv) access to health,\\nhousing, education, and jobs for migrant work-\\ners in host/transit countries and their families\\nback home. The pandemic has also highlighted\\nthe global shortage of health professionals\\nand an urgent need for global cooperation and\\nlong-term investments in medical training.\\n\\n \\n\\x0cMigration and Development Brief 32\\n\\x0cCOVID-19 Crisis Through a Migration Lens\\n\\nAcknowledgements\\n\\nThis Brief was prepared by Dilip Ratha, Su-\\npriyo De, Eung Ju Kim, Ganesh Seshan, and\\nNadege Desiree Yameogo of the Migration\\nand Remittances Team, Jobs Group, Social\\nProtection and Jobs Global Practice; and Sonia\\nPlaza of the Finance, Competitiveness, and\\nInnovation Global Practice.

If that pattern were to be repeat-\\ned, the COVID-19 crisis could last longer than\\ncurrently projected by many governments, with\\nseveral recurrences over the next 24 months.\\n\\nFast-spreading contagion, high case fatality\\nrates, inadequate medical facilities, and a lack\\nof vaccine cure (so far) have prompted societ-\\nies to lock down, reduced business hours and\\npractice social distancing. A response to the\\ncoronavirus outbreak in China in December\\n2019 was the imposition of a ban on interna-\\ntional travel and quarantines for international\\narrivals. Subsequently, most countries have\\nimposed a ban on the arrival of not only for-\\neigners but also of returning nationals.\\n\\n1.1 Impacts On Employment Of\\nForeign Workers And Their Earnings\\n\\nThese measures have brought global economic\\nactivities to a near standstill. Such simultane-\\nous suspension of activities in all parts of the\\nworld is unprecedented in history. Worldwide,\\nmany businesses, especially small and medi-\\num enterprises and informal businesses, have\\nclosed. According to the International Mon-\\netary Fund (IMF), the world economy is ex-\\npected to contract by 3 percent in 2020 in the\\nbaseline scenario, a change of nearly 6 percent\\ncompared with 2019. Advanced economies are\\nprojected to decline by 6.1 percent and emerg-\\ning market and developing economies by\\n1.0-2.2 percent in 2020. Also, there is substan-\\ntial risk of continued economic recession well\\ninto 2021. The worst case scenario anticipates\\n\\nFigure 1.1 Three Phases of the Spanish Flu, 1918-19\\n\\n(Deaths per 1000 persons, United Kingdom)\\n\\n25 -\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nSource: Data are based on Taubenberger and Morens (2006: 15).\\n\\n \\n\\x0cCOVID-19 Crisis Through a Migration Lens\\n\\neven lower growth (IMF 2020).\\' According to\\nthe latest regional economic updates published\\nby the World Bank, real economic growth could\\nfall to -0.5 percent in the East Asia and Pacific\\nregion, 4.4 percent in Europe and Central Asia,\\n-4.6 percent in Latin America and the Caribbe-\\nan (LAC), 1.8 percent in the Middle East and\\nNorth Africa (MENA), -2.8 percent in South\\nAsia, and -5.1 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa\\n(Arezki et al. 2020; Calderon et al. 2020; World\\nBank 2020a-d).\\n\\nWhen viewed through a migration lens, the\\neconomic crisis induced by COVID-19 could be\\neven longer, deeper, and more pervasive than\\nthese estimates imply. In host countries, the\\nCOVID-19 crisis has created additional chal-\\nlenges in sectors that depend on the availabili-\\nty of migrant workers. The crisis has dispropor-\\ntionately impacted food and hospitality, retail\\nand wholesale, tourism and transport, and\\nmanufacturing. As the farming season begins\\nin many countries, there are emerging signs of\\nlabor shortages in the agriculture sector of in-\\ndustrial countries that rely on migrant workers.\\nGiven the seasonality of agriculture, worker\\nshortages have given rise to concerns about\\nfood security later in the year.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe crisis has presented a challenge for the\\ncross-sectoral mobility of workers, which could\\nbe particularly hard for lower-skilled migrant\\nworkers, especially informal and undocument-\\ned workers. During the global financial crisis\\nin 2009, many migrant workers moved from\\nconstruction to agriculture and retail. Such\\nintersectoral movement may be difficult at this\\ntime because the sectors that need more work-\\ners—such as health and information technolo-\\ngy—require specific skills and prior training.\\n\\nThe crisis has greatly increased the demand for\\nhealth care services, and a global competition\\nhas already begun with many developed coun-\\ntries announcing incentives to recruit doctors\\nand nurses from abroad. There is a global\\nneed to train more health professionals and\\nprovide recognition of skills in host countries in\\nthe long term.\\n\\nMigrant workers tend to be particularly vulner-\\nable, more than native-born workers, to losses\\nof employment and wages during an economic\\ncrisis in their host country. During the global\\nfinancial crisis, the average unemployment\\nrate for foreign-born workers in the EU-28\\ncountries rose from 11.1 percent in 2007 to\\n16.4 percent in 2009, significantly higher than\\nthe increase among native-born workers. Even\\na decade later, in 2018, the unemployment\\nrate remained high for foreign-born workers,\\nwhile it had fallen below the pre-crisis rate for\\nnative-born workers. The unemployment rate\\nfor foreign-born workers is especially high in\\nItaly and Spain, which have been hit hard by\\nthe coronavirus.\\n\\nMigration flows are likely to fall, but the stock\\nof international migrants may not decrease\\nimmediately. In 2019, there were around 272\\nmillion international migrants (including 26\\nmillion refugees). Under normal circumstances,\\nmigrants losing jobs would consider return-\\ning home. However, that has become nearly\\nimpossible because of travel bans and the sus-\\npension of transportation services. As a result,\\nthe rate of voluntary return migration is likely\\nto fall, except in the case of a few cross-border\\nmigration corridors in the South (such as Ven-\\nezuela-Colombia, Nepal-India, Zimbabwe-\\nSouth Africa, Myanmar-Thailand).? In other\\nwords, more people will stay on in their host\\ncountry than is typical.\\n\\x0cMigration and Development Brief 32\\n\\nFigure 1.2 Migrant Workers Are More Vulnerable to Risks of Unemployment During\\n\\nan Economic Crisis\\n\\nUnemployment rate (%), EU-28,\\nduring global financial crisis 2008-2009\\n\\n16.4\\n\\nMM) Native Born\\nMM Foreign Born\\n\\n \\n\\n2007 2009\\n\\nSource: Eurostat data\\nNote: EU = European Union.\\n\\nIn the long term, income gaps between coun-\\ntries constitute the most important driver of\\nmigration pressure. The average per capita\\nincome in high-income countries was 54 times\\nthat in low-income countries, according to the\\nWorld Bank (2019). The present crisis will not\\nlower the income gap sufficiently to reduce\\nmigration pressures. On the contrary, income\\ninequality between the low-skilled and high-\\nskilled is likely to increase due to the crisis.\\n\\n1.2 Impacts on Internal Migration\\n\\nThe number of internal migrants is about\\ntwo-and-a-half times that of international\\nmigrants. China and India each have over\\n\\n100 million internal migrants. For the poorer\\nsections of the population, especially from un-\\nder-developed rural areas, migration to urban\\neconomic centers provides an escape from\\npoverty and unemployment. Remittances from\\nthese migrants, typically smaller amounts than\\n\\n5\\n\\n2018\\n\\nthose from international migrants, serve as a\\nlifeline and insurance for families left behind.\\n\\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has placed many in-\\nternal migrant workers in dire conditions, many\\nlosing their (mostly informal) jobs and unable\\nto return home due to disruption to public\\ntransport services and movement restrictions.\\nThis is the reality for most migrant workers,\\nespecially those working in the informal sector\\nand living in overcrowded slums.\\n\\nLockdowns, travel bans, and social distancing\\nmeasures in response to the crisis have dispro-\\nportionately affected internal migrant work-\\ners, who found themselves stranded, unable\\nto return either to their places of work or their\\ncommunities of origin. Without adequate\\naccess to housing, basic water and sanitation,\\nhealth facilities, or social safety nets to help\\nthem survive such restrictions, these migrants\\nhave become even more vulnerable to conta-\\n\\x0cCOVID-19 Crisis Through a Migration Lens\\n\\ngion risks. If discrimination and xenophobic\\nattitudes affected migrants before, the current\\ncrisis has exacerbated such social tensions.\\nThe crisis has created a chaotic and painful\\nprocess of mass return for internal migrants in\\nIndia and many countries in Latin America. As\\naresult, the COVID-19 containment measures\\nmight even have contributed to spreading the\\nepidemic. The loss of jobs and livelihood has\\nalso ruptured an important lifeline to rural\\nhouseholds in many countries.\\n\\nGovernments need to address the challenges\\nfacing internal migrants by including them in\\nprograms that provide health services and\\ncash transfer and other social programs, and\\nby protecting them from discrimination. Some\\ngovernments are already providing some as-\\nsistance to these vulnerable groups who are at\\nrisk of spreading the virus. For instance, in In-\\ndia, the government has now set up camps with\\n\\nbasic provisions to provide shelter to stranded\\nmigrants in cities and districts of destination,\\ntransit, and origin. Some countries are provid-\\ning cash support to affected and vulnerable\\ngroups with a specific allocation for internal\\nmigrants and returned migrant workers (World\\nFood Program 2020).\\n\\n1.3 Remittance Flows to Decline in 2020\\n\\nThe persistence of the stock of international\\nmigrants over an economic cycle or a crisis is\\nan important factor in the persistence or resil-\\nience of remittances. Not only do new migrants\\nsend money home but also those migrants who\\narrived along time ago. Indeed, migrants new\\nand old increase the amounts they send home\\nduring times of crisis and hardship in their\\ncountry of origin, a phenomenon noted in the\\nliterature as the countercyclicality of remittanc-\\nes. Remittances (as a share of GDP) tend to be\\n\\nFigure 1.3 Event Study: Remittances to the Philippines Increased During the Bird Flu,\\nbut Decreased During the Global Financial Crisis\\n\\nPercent change (y-o-y, 3-month moving average)\\n\\n30 +\\n\\n25 4\\n\\n20 +\\n\\n15 4\\n\\n10 +\\n\\n \\n\\n---- Bird Flu (Nov. 2003)\\nony «==ee Financial Crisis (Sep. 2008)\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n-4 -2\\n\\nTime (month)\\n\\nData Source: World Bank-KNOMAD remittance inflows dataset.\\n\\nNote: t = 0 November 2003 and September 2008.

During a crisis in the\\nhost country, however, remittances can decline.\\nFor instance, during the global financial crisis,\\nremittance flows to low- and middle-income\\ncountries (LMICs) declined by 5 percent in\\n2009. Similarly, the event study in figure 1.3\\nshows the countercyclical increase in remit-\\ntance flows to the Philippines during the bird flu\\npandemic in November 2003, and a procycli-\\ncal decline in response to the global financial\\ncrisis starting in September 2008.\\n\\nIn 2019, remittance flows to LMICs became\\nlarger than foreign direct investment (FDI),\\n\\nan important milestone for monitoring re-\\nsource flows to these countries. Recent data\\nreveal that in 2019, remittance flows to LMICs\\nreached $554 billion, slightly higher than our\\nearlier projection ($551 billion) published in\\nOctober 2019.4 Remittance flows to LAC and\\n\\nSouth Asia turned out to be larger than expect-\\ned in the second half of 2019.\\n\\nIn 2020, remittance flows to LMICs are expect-\\ned to decline by around 20 percent, marking\\nthe sharpest decline in recent history (table\\n\\n1.2 and figure 1.4). This is not so much due to\\na decline in the stock of international mi-\\ngrants, but largely due to a fall in wages and\\nthe employment of migrant workers in host\\nnations due to COVID-19 (see appendix for\\nthe methodology behind this projection). The\\ndecline in remittance flows is expected to be\\nsharpest in Europe and Central Asia, South\\nAsia, and Sub-Saharan Africa. These region-\\nal patterns are affected by COVID-19 and\\nalso a fall in the price of oil, which affects the\\neconomies of Russia and the Gulf Cooperation\\nCouncil (GCC) countries in particular.

This is still more than\\ndouble the SDG target (10.c) of 3 percent by\\n2030.° Sub-Saharan Africa continued to have\\nthe highest average cost, at about 9 percent.\\nRemittance costs across many African corri-\\ndors and small islands in the Pacific remained\\nabove 10 percent.

However, poor and irregular\\nmigrants have lower or no access to digital\\npayment instruments—such as bank accounts,\\npayment cards, or mobile wallets—to fund or\\ndisburse remittance transactions. Many poor\\nhouseholds in LMICs also lack access to trans-\\naction accounts to receive remittances. Online\\ntransactions also require RSPs to be able to\\nremotely collect and verify identity documents\\nand exercise additional vigilance against\\nhigher risks of fraud and financial crime, to\\ncomply with anti-money laundering and coun-\\ntering of financing of terrorism (AML/CFT)\\nregulations.\\'® However, such due diligence has\\nbecome difficult amid staff shortages.\"\\' The\\ndisruption of formal remittance services and\\n\\na lack of access to banking or online services\\nmay shift remittances to informal channels.\\n\\nSome RSPs have temporarily waived the fees\\nfor sending money home, but such waivers are\\nnot sustainable. To encourage RSPs to facil-\\nitate remittance inflows, some governments\\n(notably that of Pakistan) have announced tax\\nincentives equivalent to the remittance fees\\nwaived.\\n\\n1.5 Policy Responses Should Be Inclu-\\nsive of Migrants and Their Remittances\\n\\nLockdowns and travel bans directly affect the\\nemployment and wages of foreign workers.\\nLockdowns in labor camps and dormitories can\\nincrease the risk of contagion among migrant\\nworkers. Many migrants have been stranded\\ndue to the suspension of transport services.\\nLockdowns have also closed the offices of\\nRSPs, some of whom are also grappling with\\nemployees who have fallen sick, thus affecting\\nthe flow of remittances.\\n\\nTo address shortages of workers in agriculture\\nand health sectors, some countries have grant-\\ned visas to attract agricultural workers, even\\n\\nchartering flights to bring them in. Many coun-\\n\\ntries have announced incentives or relaxed visa\\nrestrictions to recruit health professionals from\\nforeign countries.\\n\\nIn general, most countries use residency crite-\\nria to determine whether foreigners are entitled\\nto public health care services (box 1). So far,\\ngovernment policy responses have mostly\\nexcluded migrants. There is a strong argument\\nfor including migrants in the near-term health\\nstrategies of all countries, recognizing the\\npositive externalities associated with health, or\\nconversely, the negative externalities associat-\\ned with pandemics.\\n\\nTable 1.3 summarizes short-, medium-, and\\nlong-term interventions that could be consid-\\nered by the World Bank Group. Specifically,\\noperational interventions could be considered\\nto support: (i) stranded migrants; (ii) access to\\nhealth care, housing, education, and jobs for\\nmigrant workers in host/transit countries and\\ntheir families back home; and (iii) remittance\\ninfrastructure.\\n\\nKeeping remittances flowing\\n\\nThe World Bank has initiated a weekly sur-\\nvey of remittance costs in several important\\ncorridors to assess the effects of the COVID-19\\ncrisis on the remittances sector. Initial find-\\nings show that authorities in many sending\\nand receiving countries observed a decline\\n\\nin remittance flows and expect this trend to\\ncontinue. RSPs are not classified as essential\\nservices. As such, their services have been\\ninterrupted or their working hours reduced.\\nThe use of digital channels for sending money\\nis increasing due to the closure of brick-and-\\nmortar services.\\'* Meanwhile, a large percent-\\nage of migrant workers and their families back\\nhome are unbanked or under-banked, and are\\nfacing challenges in meeting the due diligence\\nrequirements of digital channels. In the short\\nrun, the services that remain available are in\\ngeneral priced lower than those that preced-\\ned the COVID-19 measures, according to\\n\\n10\\n\\x0cMigration and Development Brief 32\\n\\nBox 1. A Comparison of National\\nPolicies Regarding Migrant Workers’\\nAccess to Health Care\\n\\nAccording to the forthcoming Migration and\\nthe Law Database, economic migrants\" enjoy\\nfull access to public health care in 80 out of a\\ntotal of 132 sampled countries, provided that\\ngeneral requirements for participation in the\\nrespective scheme are fulfilled.’* Another 40\\ncountries allow migrants access to health care\\nconditionally, while 12 countries (most of which\\nare located in South Asia and the Middle East\\na North Africa regions) completely exclude\\nmigrants from their health care systems.\\n\\nMany countries use residency to determine\\nwhether foreigners are entitled to public health\\ncare services. The national laws and regu-\\nlations of Portugal and Dominican Republic\\nlink health entitlements to the residency status\\nrather than nationality of a person. In Croatia,\\nBulgaria, Czech Republic, the United States\\n\\nof America, and Singapore, a person needs to\\nobtain permanent residency status first in order\\nto enjoy health care protection on par with cit-\\nizens. Under Turkish laws and regulations, for-\\neigners may benefit from general health insur-\\nance schemes provided that they have resided\\nin Turkey more than a year. Other national laws\\ndelegate the role of protecting migrants’ health\\nto employers. In the United Arab Emirates and\\nKuwait, employers are required to cover the\\ncosts of health insurance for migrant workers\\nor face penalties for noncompliance.\\n\\nAccess to health care for economic migrants\\ncan be restricted to emergency life-saving care\\nor infectious disease prevention.

In the past, remittances\\nhave been countercyclical during times of di-\\nsaster in the recipient economy. This time, how-\\never, the pandemic has affected all countries,\\nand the economic fallout is likely to vary due to\\ncountry-specific characteristics.\\n\\n2.1 East Asia and the Pacific\\n\\nRemittance trends. Remittance flows to the\\nEast Asia and Pacific region grew by 2.6\\npercent in 2019, about 4.3 percentage points\\nlower than the growth rate in 2018. In 2020,\\nremittance flows are expected to decline by\\n13 percent due to the impact of COVID-19.\\nThe slowdown is expected to be driven by\\ndeclining inflows from the United States, the\\nlargest source of remittances to the East Asia\\nand Pacific region, and from Hong Kong SAR,\\nChina. Several remittance-dependent coun-\\n\\ntries such as those in the Pacific Islands could\\nsee households at risk as remittance incomes\\ndecline over this period (World Bank 2020a). A\\nrecovery of 7.5 percent growth for the region is\\nanticipated in 2021.\\n\\nRemittances to the Philippines rose by 4 per-\\ncent in 2019, to reach $35.2 billion, up from\\nthe 3 percent growth seen in 2018 (figure 2.1).\\nYear-on-year growth in remittances for Janu-\\nary 2020 was 6.6 percent but this likely reflects\\na period prior to widespread COVID-19 mea-\\nsures being adopted in host countries. Remit-\\ntances to Indonesia returned to a single-digit\\nannual growth of 4 percent in 2019 after expe-\\nriencing double-digit growth in 2018, the latter\\ndue to an expansion in remittance flows from\\nthe Middle East (particularly Saudi Arabia).\\n\\nBy contrast, remittances from the Middle East\\nshrunk in 2019 while growth remained in the\\ndouble digits from Asia, particularly in Hong\\nKong SAR, China; and Taiwan, China.\\nRemittance costs.

The Philippine government\\'s\\nefforts to halt the spread of the coronavirus\\nby banning travel to several countries—in-\\ncluding Taiwan, China; Macau; Hong Kong\\nSAR, China; and South Korea—was short\\nlived amid resistance from overseas Filipino\\nworkers concerned about potential job losses\\nif they were unable to travel back to their host\\ncountries after home visits. The government\\nannounced that new deployment to these\\ncountries and mainland China would be scaled\\ndown while deployment to the GCC countries\\n\\nty\\n\\nwas expected to fall amid travel bans imposed\\nby the GCC.\" As of April 30, 2020, 1677\\noverseas Filipino workers had tested positive\\nfor COVID-19, of which 451 had recovered\\nand 201 had died. Only workers barred from\\ntravelling to China were entitled to a subsidy\\nof 10,000 pesos (about $198), which had not\\nbeen extended to those affected by travel\\nbans, particularly in Qatar and Kuwait.\\n\\nOver 60,000 migrant workers from Myanmar,\\nCambodia, and the Lao People’s Democratic\\nRepublic fled Thailand, defying requests by\\nofficials to remain in the country to help con-\\ntain the virus and raising fears of cross-border\\ninfections. Elsewhere, Singapore, which ap-\\npeared to have early success in containing the\\ncoronavirus among its residents, was seeing\\n\\na new surge in cases from a previously over-\\nlooked source. Over three-quarters of these\\nnew cases were related to low-skilled migrant\\nworkers housed in dormitories. There were\\n\\x0cCOVID-19 Crisis Through a Migration Lens\\n\\nmore than 200,000 migrant workers from\\nAsia residing in a total of 43 dormitories in\\nthe country.\\n\\nA lockdown in Malaysia was causing hardship\\nfor foreign workers, particular daily casual\\nworkers. The Indonesian Ministry of Foreign\\nAffairs (MOFA) indicated that it had sent more\\nthan 3,000 aid packages to its citizens in Ma-\\nlaysia and was preparing an additional 3,000\\nmore.\\'® Malaysia is the main destination for\\nIndonesian workers, hosting half of Indonesia\\'s\\nestimated 3.7 million workers abroad in 2019.17\\n\\nUndocumented migrant workers in host\\nSoutheast Asian countries risked detention\\nand deportation by visiting health centers to\\nbe checked or treated for the coronavirus. The\\nMinistry of Labor in Taiwan, China, planned to\\ninspect the documentation of migrant caregiv-\\ners. A civic group called for granting amnesty\\nto the estimated 50,000 undocumented work-\\ners in the economy, citing these workers’ fear of\\ncoming forward to report COVID-19 symp-\\ntoms. In Malaysia, civic groups similarly called\\non the government to impose a moratorium on\\n\\nthe arrest and deportation of undocumented\\nmigrants in order to facilitate their testing and\\ntreatment for the coronavirus.\\n\\nThroughout the East Asia and Pacific region,\\nmigrant workers were left out of financial\\nsupport from host governments to counter the\\neconomic fallout from containing the coronavi-\\nrus pandemic, and were at times being told to\\nsimply return home-though many were unable\\nto travel due to travel bans or flight cancella-\\ntions. A recent survey of migrant workers in\\nNew South Wales, Australia, found that half\\nhad lost their jobs and one-fifth had seen\\ntheir work hours reduced while none would\\n\\nbe eligible for government assistance. A plan\\nto pay employers A$1,500 (around US$950)\\nevery two weeks per employee did not extend\\nto those employing temporary migrant workers\\n(except New Zealanders). While the Singa-\\nporean government waived the monthly levy\\nof $$750 (about US$530) for foreign workers\\nrequired of employers and committed to pro-\\nviding the latter a rebate, contract workers did\\nnot expect to receive any financial support.\\n\\nFigure 2.3 Remittance Inflows to Europe and Central Asia Remained Strong in 2019\\n\\n($ billion, 2019e)\\n\\n15.8\\n\\n  \\n\\n4.2 42\\n24 235 23 23 24\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n2 3 S o£ «© @ £ @\\n& @ x oS & “6 oF & <\\ner ot we F SWS SF &\\nwe sf x\\nof € Ss\\nx\\n&\\n\\n(Percentage of GDP, 2019e)\\n\\n     \\n\\n16.2\\npe 14.2\\n114 10.5 10.2 95\\n\\n \\n\\nSources: World Bank staff estimates, World Development Indicators, and IMF Balance of Payments statistics.\\n\\nNote: GDP = gross domestic product; 2019e = estimated for 2019.\\n\\n18\\n\\x0cMigration and Development Brief 32\\n\\n2.2 Europe and Central Asia\\n\\nRemittance trends. Remittances to Europe\\nand Central Asia remained strong in 2019,\\ngrowing by about 6 percent to $65 billion in\\n2019. Ukraine remained the largest recipient\\nof remittances in the region, receiving a record\\nhigh of nearly $16 billion in 2019 (figure 2.3),\\nwith the lion\\'s share of remittances coming\\nfrom Poland (about two-thirds of the total),\\nfollowed by the Czech Republic, Russia, the\\nUnited States, and the United Kingdom. Small-\\ner remittance-dependent economies in the\\nregion, such as the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan,\\nand Uzbekistan, particularly benefited from a\\nrebound of economic activity in Russia.\\n\\nIn 2020, the growth of remittance flows to\\n\\nthe region is estimated to fall significantly, by\\nabout 28 percent, due to the combined effect\\nof the global coronavirus pandemic and tum-\\nbling oil prices. Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and\\nRussia, the region\\'s largest oil producers, are\\nexpected to suffer budget shortfalls, mount-\\ning pressure on their currencies, and possible\\nrecessions. Notably, the high dependence on\\nremittances from Russia is likely to increase\\nthe impact of negative external shocks on the\\nCentral Asian economies of the Kyrgyz Repub-\\nlic, Tajikistan, and Uzbekistan. Remittances\\nsent home by millions of expatriate workers in\\nRussia, most of them employed in the construc-\\ntion sector, account for about two-thirds of\\nGDP in both the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajiki-\\nstan. (Outward remittance flows from Russia,\\nas expressed in U.S. dollars, would be lower\\ndue to the valuation effect of a weaker ruble\\nagainst the U.S. dollar.) Indeed, the Kyrgyz Re-\\npublic saw remittances fall 9 percent in the first\\ntwo months of 2020 compared with the same\\nperiod the previous year.\\n\\nRemittance costs. The average cost of sending\\n$200 to the Europe and Central Asia region\\ndeclined modestly to 6.48 percent in 2020\\n\\nQ1 from 6.67 percent a year earlier. Without\\n\\n19\\n\\nRussia, the average cost was higher, declining\\nfrom 7.44 percent to 6.94 percent in the same\\nperiod. The cost of sending $200 from Russia\\nremained the lowest globally, though it rose\\nfrom 1.9 percent to 2.1 percent, mainly due to\\na cost increase for the Russia-Ukraine corridor.\\nThe differences in costs across corridors in the\\nregion are substantial; the highest average cost\\nfor sending $200 in remittances was from Tur-\\ney to Bulgaria, while the lowest average cost\\nwas from Russia to Azerbaijan (figure 2.4).\\n\\nMigration trends. According to data from the\\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Ref-\\nugees (UNHCR), 124,000 irregular migrants\\narrived in the European Union (EV) in 2019,\\ndown sharply from a peak of more than 1 mil-\\nion in 2015. The Central Mediterranean route,\\nused by about half of all irregular migrants to\\nthe European Union in 2016, accounted for\\nonly 9 percent of irregular travel, while the\\npace of arrivals through the Eastern Mediter-\\nranean route surged in mid-2019, with Greece\\naccounting for 59 percent of arrivals. While\\noverall migration numbers fell in 2019, Greece,\\nSpain, and Italy still received the most irregular\\nmigrants among the EU countries. Greece dis-\\nplaced Italy as the most popular arrival point\\nfor irregular migrants, with 74,600 arrivals in\\n2019. Only 11,000 irregular migrants landed\\nin Italy in 2019, down sharply from a peak of\\n181,000 arrivals in 2016.22\\n\\n \\n\\nAfghans accounted for 19 percent of irreg-\\nular migrants to the European Union and\\n\\n40 percent of those travelling by the Eastern\\nMediterranean route in 2019, representing the\\nsingle-largest nationality.

Some of them returned\\nto Ukraine, though many were stranded\\nabroad. It was reported that many short-term\\nUkrainian workers in Italy, the third-most popu-\\nlar destination (with 11 percent of Ukrainian\\nmigrant workers) after Poland (40 percent)\\nand Russia (25 percent), were trapped behind\\na nationwide lockdown, unable to return home\\ndespite having expired visas.\\n\\nEven borders that are usually open, such as\\nbetween Russia and Central Asia, hardened as\\nCOVID-19 spread through the region. Hun-\\ndreds of migrant workers from Central Asian\\ncountries were stranded at various airports\\n\\nafter Russia and other neighboring countries\\nclosed borders and grounded flights to the\\nKyrgyz Republic, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan,\\nforcing them to camp out at the terminals for\\nweeks until the issue was resolved by their\\nrespective governments. Adding to the bottle-\\nneck at airports, the travel bans coincided with\\nspring celebrations in Central Asia when many\\nmigrant workers return home after laboring\\nthrough the winter. The COVID-19 crisis also\\ntransformed the discussion on migration as\\ntravel restrictions or border closings highlight-\\ned the vulnerability of stranded migrant work-\\ners exposed to unhygienic conditions in crowd-\\ned airports, unable to self-quarantine and with\\nlimited or no access to medical services.\\n\\n2.3 Latin America and the Caribbean\\n\\nRemittance trends. Remittances to the LAC re-\\ngion increased by 7.4 percent in 2019, reaching\\n\\n20\\n\\x0cMigration and Development Brief 32\\n\\n$96 billion. Remittance inflows were bolstered\\nby a low foreign-born unemployment rate of\\n3.1 percent in the United States. In particular,\\nyear-on-year employment for February in-\\ncreased by 211,000 in the construction sector,\\nwhere a large number of migrants work.\\n\\nNonetheless, growth in remittance inflows\\n\\nfor 2019 was uneven across countries in the\\nregion. Brazil, Guatemala, and Honduras saw\\na rise in remittances of more than 12 percent\\nin 2019. Colombia, Ecuador, Nicaragua,\\n\\nand Panama saw an increase of more than\\n\\n6 percent, while remittance growth in Bolivia\\nand Paraguay declined by -3.8 percent and\\n-2.2 percent, respectively.2! Remittances are\\nparticularly important to some of the smaller\\nregional economies.

These\\n\\nprojected growth rates are lower than the\\ndecrease of 12.3 percent during the global\\nfinancial crisis of 2009. The anticipated drop in\\nremittances is likely to be sharper for LAC than\\nother regions. This is because Italy, Spain, and\\nthe United States, which are the region\\'s main\\nremittance-source countries, have been hit\\nhard by the pandemic. Some corridors that are\\nhighly dependent on remittances from these\\ncountries, such as those involving Ecuador and\\nColombia, are likely to register larger declines.\\nPrevailing high unemployment rates in Italy\\nand Spain are likely to be exacerbated by the\\neconomic impact of the COVID-19 crisis, fur-\\nther constraining remittance flows to Bolivia,\\nEcuador, Colombia, Paraguay, and Peru.\\n\\nRemittance costs.

The impact of social\\ndistancing guidelines and stay-at-home orders\\nhad severely impacted jobs in retail, hospitality,\\nand services, in which a large percentage of\\nLatin American migrants were employed.\\n\\nThe latest U.S. data on total nonfarm pay-\\nrollemployment reported a sharp decline of\\n\\n \\n\\n(Percent)\\n16 5 highest-cost corridors\\nMM Fourth Quarter 2018\\n1¢ HE Fourth Quarter 2019\\n12\\n10\\n8\\n& 5 lowest-cost corridors\\n4\\nJ y I\\n0\\n2 R s\\n» a eS Ss » & xs Reg & ee e\\n- »P Ss CF oO ss »P x9 oO\\n© x > é we 2 & & Ss\\n2 eC 9 ~ e Ce oe Ca ye\\n& @ oe a Re x >\\n> 3 2 e o eS\\nwe wt ys\\nse s\\n\\n701,000 individuals, reflecting the impact of\\nCOVID-19 during the first two weeks of March\\n2020.

These\\nsectors are typically the largest nonfarm em-\\nployers of Mexican and Central American mi-\\ngrants. Similarly, Spain lost more than 800,000\\njobs in March, led by the services sector,\\nfollowed by the construction and agriculture\\nsectors. More unemployment is expected in\\ndeveloped and developing countries for April\\nand the coming months. According to some\\nestimates, in the United States, a record 20\\nmillion persons sought unemployment benefits,\\nimplying an unemployment rate of around 15\\npercent, in April 2020.73\\n\\nCOVID-19 could impact migrants’ health and\\nmortality since they are particularly vulnerable\\nto the disease.

According to the mayor\\nof New York City, 34 percent of people who\\nhad died from the disease in the city through\\nthe first week in April were from the Hispanic\\ncommunity (NBC 2020). This is in part due to\\nthe precarious condition of urban immigrants,\\ncongested living conditions, and prevailing\\nhealth conditions that make them vulnerable to\\nthe illness.\\n\\nAmid the lockdown in the United States, mi-\\ngration processes and asylum cases have been\\npostponed, and more restrictive measures\\n\\nare being implemented. For example, the U.S.\\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention\\nissued an order to turn away any people who\\ncross the southwestern border illegally instead\\nof taking them to a detention center where\\nthey can ask for asylum in the United States.\\nAccording to the U.S. Customs and Border Pro-\\ntection (2020), 80 percent of people coming to\\nthe border after this order were being returned\\nto their country within two hours.\\n\\nThe closure of borders has created a pool of\\nmigrants, including return migrants, stranded\\n\\nin various countries. In Mexico, Central Amer-\\nican migrants waiting for their applications to\\nbe processed under the “Remain in Mexico”\\nprogram were uncertain as to whether their\\ncases would be reprogrammed. Many Venezu-\\nelan migrants were returning home from Chile,\\nColombia, Ecuador, and Peru after losing their\\nmeans of subsistence due to lockdown mea-\\nsures. Social tensions have flared in some host\\ncountries due to competing needs to support\\nvulnerable host and migrant populations. It is\\nstill too early to know the impacts of COVID-19\\non migratory flows, since these will depend on\\nhow long the restrictions to contain the disease\\nremain in place.\\n\\nDetained migrants awaiting deportation or\\nresolution of asylum claims are also at greater\\nrisk of becoming infected due to the confined\\nnature of detention areas. Spain has released\\nsome of its detainees.

Remittances to the MENA\\nregion are projected to fall by about 20 percent\\nin 2020, following a rise of 2.6 percent in 2019\\n(figure 2.7). The anticipated decline in remit-\\ntances to the region can be attributed to the\\nglobal slowdown due to coronavirus and also\\nthe impact of lower oil prices in GCC countries.\\nAll major remittance-receiving countries will\\nlikely see a collapse of remittances.*4 Remit-\\ntances from the euro area would be additional-\\n\\nly impacted by the pre-COVID economic slow-\\ndown in the area and the depreciation of the\\neuro against the U.S. dollar. This would partic-\\nularly affect Morocco and Tunisia (projected\\nto have remittance declines of around 17-18\\npercent). In 2021, the growth of remittances to\\nthe MENA region is expected to recover, albeit\\nat a slow pace of around 1.6 percent due to\\nmoderate growth in the euro area and weak\\nGCC outflows.\\n\\nRemittance costs. The cost of sending $200\\n\\nto the MENA region increased only slightly in\\n2020 Q1, to 7 percent, compared with 6.76\\npercent in same quarter of the previous year.\\nThis is close to the global average for 2020\\nQ1, which was 6.79 percent.

The Saudi Arabia-Syria corridor has\\nexperienced a dramatic fall in costs as the civil\\nwar in Syria has receded.\\n\\nDisplaced populations. While the coronavi-\\nrus crisis ravages many countries, the MENA\\nregion continues to bear the burden of wide-\\nspread forced displacement due to conflicts in\\nSyria, rag, and Yemen. In response, UNHCR?5\\nhas formulated a COVID-19 Emergency\\nResponse. It focuses on (i) continuing, adapt-\\ning, and delivering protection and assistance\\nto the most vulnerable; (ii) advocating for the\\ninclusion of refugees, internally displaced per-\\nsons (IDPs), and other marginalized groups in\\nnational public health and other responses; (iii)\\nprioritizing immediate interventions to prevent\\ninfections; (iv) strengthening communication\\nwith communities; and (v) empowering indi-\\nviduals and families to make the best decisions\\non how to care for themselves, through cash-\\nbased assistance (UNHCR 2020). As of April\\n\\n2020, UNHCR recorded 5.6 million persons of\\nconcern from Syria (including asylum seek-\\ners, refugees, and IDPs). There were about\\n3.6 million Syrian refugees or asylum seekers\\nin Turkey, 0.9 million in Lebanon, 0.7 million\\n\\nin Jordan, and 0.2. million in Iraq. Accord-\\n\\ning to UNHCR, as of March 2020, Iraq itself\\nhad huge numbers of IDPs: about 300,000 in\\nformal camps and another 150,000 in informal\\nsettlements. Also, about 190,000 persons had\\nfled Yemen into countries in the region (mainly\\nOman, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, and Djibouti).\\n\\n2.5 South Asia\\n\\nRemittance trends. Remittances to South Asia\\nare projected to decline sharply by 22 percent\\nto $109 billion in 2020. This is a significant and\\nunprecedented deceleration compared with\\nthe growth of 6.1 percent seen in 2019. The\\ndeceleration in remittances to the South Asian\\nregion in 2020 is driven by the global econom-\\nic slowdown due to the coronavirus outbreak\\nas well as oil price declines.

South Asia was the least\\ncostly region to send $200 to (at 4.95 percent)\\nin 2020 Q1. Some of the lowest-cost corri-\\ndors—including those originating in the GCC\\ncountries and Singapore, and the India-Nepal\\ncorridor—had costs below the SDG target of\\n\\n3 percent. This is probably due to high vol-\\numes, competitive markets, and deployment\\nof technology (figure 2.10). But costs are well\\nover 10 percent in the highest-cost corridors\\n(UK to Afghanistan, Thailand to India, Paki-\\nstan to Afghanistan, Pakistan to Bangladesh,\\nSouth Africa to India) due to low volumes, little\\ncompetition, and regulatory concerns. LMIC\\nsenders such as South Africa and Thailand also\\nhad high costs. Banking regulations (related\\nto AML/CFT) raise the risk profile of RSPs,\\nand thereby increase costs for some receiving\\ncountries such as Afghanistan and sending\\ncountries such as Pakistan.\\n\\n26\\n\\x0cMigration and Development Brief 32\\n\\nMigration trends. The coronavirus crisis has\\naffected both international and internal mi-\\ngration in the South Asia region. As the early\\nphases of the crisis unfolded, many inter-\\nnational migrants, especially from the GCC\\ncountries, returned to countries such as India,\\nPakistan, and Bangladesh—until travel restric-\\ntions halted these flows. Some migrants had to\\nbe evacuated by governments, such as those\\nof China and Iran. Afghanistan also saw large\\nflows of returnees from Iran (150,000) and\\nPakistan (60,000) (BBC News 2020). The lock-\\ndown in India has impacted the livelihoods of a\\nlarge proportion of the country\\'s nearly 40 mil-\\nlion internal migrants. Around 50,000-60,000\\nmoved from urban centers to rural areas of or-\\nigin in the span of a few days. The government\\nset up camps with basic provisions to provide\\nshelter to these migrants in cities and districts\\nof destination, transit, and origin (Bindra and\\nSharma 2020). As of March 2020, 859,161\\nRohingya refugees remained in crowded camp\\nconditions in Bangladesh.\\n\\nBefore the coronavirus crisis, migrant outflows\\nfrom the region were robust. The number of\\nrecorded, primarily low-skilled emigrants from\\n\\nIndia and Pakistan rose in 2019 relative to the\\nprior year but is expected to decline in 2020\\ndue to the pandemic and oil price declines\\nimpacting the GCC countries. In India, the\\nnumber of low-skilled emigrants seeking man-\\ndatory clearance for emigration rose slightly\\nby 8 percent to 368,048 in 2019 (Ministry of\\nExternal Affairs, India). In Pakistan, the number\\nof emigrants jumped 63 percent to 625,203 in\\n2019 (Bureau of Emigration & Overseas Em-\\nployment, Pakistan), largely due to a doubling\\nof emigration to Saudi Arabia.\\n\\n2.6 Sub-Saharan Africa\\n\\nRemittance trends. Remittances to Sub-Saha-\\nran Africa decreased slightly, by 0.5 percent,\\nbetween 2018 and 2019 to remain close to $48\\nbillion. Due to the COVID-19 crisis, remittanc-\\nes are expected to decline by 23.1 percent\\n\\nin 2020 to reach $37 billion, while a recovery\\nof 4.0 percent is expected in 2021.

These large economies host a\\nlarge share of Sub-Saharan migrants and\\n\\nare a source of close to one-quarter of total\\nremittances sent to the region, leaving Sub-Sa-\\nharan Africa highly vulnerable to any shocks\\noccurring in these countries, and especially\\nthe COVID-19 pandemic. Remittances are\\n\\nthe main source of foreign exchange revenue\\nfor the region, and they serve as an import-\\nant channel for risk sharing in the developing\\nworld. But with a covariate shock such as\\nCOVID 19 that affects both the recipient and\\nsource country, the loss of this important chan-\\nnel will probably lead to further poverty and\\ndeprivation.

City-sized locust swarms were at-\\ntacking crops and threatening the food supply\\nof millions of people in the region.\\n\\nNigeria remains the largest recipient of remit-\\ntances in the region, and is the sixth-largest\\nrecipient among LMICs, with an estimated\\namount of $23.8 billion received in 2019, an\\nincrease of more than half a billion compared\\nwith 2018 (figure 2.11). Ghana and Kenya are\\nranked a distant second and third in the region,\\nwith $3.5 billion and $2.8 billion received,\\nrespectively. South Sudan has recently started\\nreporting remittances in the IMF Balance of\\nPayments statistics; in 2019 it had the region\\'s\\nhighest share of remittances, as a percentage\\nof national GDP, at more than 34 percent. For\\nthese countries where remittances account for\\na large share of GDP, a sharp decline is ex-\\npected for 2020 as many migrant workers have\\nseen their income plummet, especially in mem-\\nber countries of the Organisation for Economic\\nCo-operation and Development.\\n\\n28\\n\\x0cMigration and Development Brief 32\\n\\nRemittance costs. Sending $200 in remittanc-\\nes to Sub-Saharan Africa cost 8.9 percent on\\naverage in 2020 Q1. This is a modest decrease\\ncompared with the average cost of 9.25 per-\\ncent a year before. Sub-Saharan Africa is the\\nmost costly region to send remittances to, but\\nthere is heterogeneity across the region. The\\nmost expensive corridors are observed mainly\\nin the Southern African region, where the South\\nAfrica-Swatini corridor is the costliest, at an\\naverage of 20 percent in 2019 Q2, an increase\\nof 3 percent compared with the previous year\\'s\\nquarter.?7 In 2019 Q4, the Ghana-to-Nigeria\\ncorridor became the most expensive corri-\\n\\ndor. The cheapest corridors include those of\\nCéte d\\'Ivoire to Mali and Senegal to Mali, at\\n\\nan average cost of less than 3.6 percent. The\\nCOVID-19 pandemic has made it more difficult\\nfor migrants to remit money to Sub-Saharan\\nAfrica as most payments are still in cash and\\nsome money transfer operators are closed due\\nto the crisis. The promotion of digital technol-\\nogy combined with a regulatory environment\\nthat promotes competition in the remittanc-\\n\\nes market, and relaxing money-laundering\\nregulations, are essential for Sub-Saharan\\nAfrican countries to achieve the SDG target of\\n3 percent by 2030.\\n\\nPromoting the use of mobile money. The\\nCOVID-19 crisis has demonstrated the need for\\nSub-Saharan African countries to promote pro-\\ncedures and regulations based on mobile and\\nelectronic payments and transfers. In Kenya,\\nthe Central Bank of Kenya announced seven\\nemergency measures to encourage the use of\\nmobile money technology (as opposed to cash)\\nto curb the spread of COVID-19. All charges\\nfor transfers between mobile money wallets\\nand bank accounts were eliminated, transac-\\ntion limits were raised, and charges for mobile\\nmoney transactions were waived for amounts\\nup to K Sh 1,000 (approximately U$10). MTN\\n\\nin Uganda also waived fees on mobile money\\ntransfers for 30 days from March 20 to promote\\nthe use of cashless payments to contain the\\nvirus. In other countries (Ghana, Senegal, South\\n\\n29)\\n\\nAfrica, and Zimbabwe), money transfer opera-\\ntors or cash pickup services were either closed\\nor had reduced their hours.\\n\\nDisplaced populations. The COVID-19 pan-\\ndemic is sweeping across Africa at the same\\ntime the continent is facing record numbers\\n\\nof forcibly displaced people. Due to conflicts\\nor insecurity, Africa has registered more than\\n25 million forcibly displaced people who are\\neither IDPs or refugees. The majority of these\\ndisplaced people originate from the following\\ncountries: the Democratic Republic of Con-\\ngo, South Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia, Sudan,\\nNigeria, the Central African Republic, and\\nCameroon. Many find themselves in informal\\nsettlements and managed camps hosting tens\\nto hundreds of thousands of people.?8 High\\ndensities of forcibly displaced populations and\\nthe mobility of migrants make both groups\\nhighly vulnerable to contagion, and therefore a\\npriority in efforts to mitigate the spread of the\\ncoronavirus in Africa.\\n\\nStranded migrants. To curb the spread of\\nCOVID-19, the Government of Niger has\\nimposed several restrictions including border\\nclosures, curfews, and travel bans within the\\ncountry and a mandatory two-week quaran-\\ntine for travelers arriving in the country. These\\nrestrictions led to a sudden increase of strand-\\ned migrants. At the end of March 2020, about\\n764 migrants were stranded in Assamaka, at\\nNiger\\'s border with Algeria and another 256 at\\nits border with Libya as a result of the border\\nclosures (IOM 2020). These migrants usually\\nuse irregular channels to migrate to North Afri-\\nca and then Europe, with the majority of them\\noriginating from Niger, Mali, Guinea, Nigeria,\\nGhana, and Burkina Faso. As these stranded\\nmigrants waited to return to their countries of\\norigin through the International Organization\\nfor Migration’s Assisted Voluntary Return and\\nReintegration program, tensions at the transit\\ncenters were running high.\\n\\x0cCOVID-19 Crisis Through a Migration Lens\\n\\nAppendix: Data Notes\\nand Methodologies\\nfor Forecasting\\nRemittances and FDI\\n\\nA.1 Estimation of Remittance Flows for\\n2019\\n\\nThe 2019 estimates are based on the Balance\\nof Payment statistics of the International Mon-\\netary Fund (IMF), supplemented by data from\\ncentral banks. Where current data are not yet\\navailable, estimates and forecasts are used.\\nFor 2019, since only partial data are available\\nfor a few countries, estimates of remittance\\ninflows for those are obtained by projecting\\nremittance inflows for the current year based\\non partial quarterly or monthly year-to-year\\ngrowth rates (usually based on data from a\\ncentral bank or national statistical office).\\n\\nA.2 Methodology for Forecasting Re-\\nmittances for 2020\\n\\nThe remittance projection model used for 2020\\nis based on standard remittance estimation\\nmodels in the literature that posit remittances\\nas a function of income in migrants’ countries\\nof destination and origin (Ratha and Shaw\\n\\n2007, Carling 2008, El-Sakka and McNabb\\n1999, Adams 2009). The underlying rationale\\nis that remittance inflows are positively linked\\nto migrants’ incomes proxied by the nominal\\nper capita incomes of the migrants’ countries\\nof destination (remittance-source countries).\\nThese are also linked to the income and price\\nlevel (nominal per capita income) of migrants’\\ncountries of origin (remittance-recipient\\ncountries).?’ The dependent variable is a log of\\nthe remittances-to-migrant ratio of the remit-\\ntance-recipient country. Explanatory variables\\nare the log of nominal per capita income of the\\nsuppliers of remittances to the recipient coun-\\ntry, weighted by the share of migrant stock,\\nand the log of nominal per capita income of\\nthe recipient country. Data are from the World\\nBank\\'s World Development Indicators. The\\nmodel uses a panel of 188 countries (of all\\nincome levels) over the period 1990-2019. A\\npanel random effects estimator is used. The\\nestimates give an acceptable goodness of fit\\n(overall R-square = 0.36), and all explanatory\\nvariables are statistically significant.\\n\\nA.3 Data on Remittances, Gross Do-\\nmestic Product, Remittance Prices,\\nRefugees, and Other Variables\\n\\nThe main source for data on remittance inflows\\nand outflows is the IMF\\'s Balance of Payments\\ndatabase, which provides information on\\n\\nTable A.1 Panel Data Regression Estimates for Remittances\\n\\n \\n\\nVariables\\n\\nDependent variable: log of remittances-to-migrant ratio of remittance-\\n\\nrecipient country\\n\\nRemittance-source country per capita income weighted by migrant stock\\n\\nRemittance-recipient country per capita income\\n\\nConstant\\n\\nObservations\\n\\nNumber of countries\\n\\nSource: World Bank staff estimates based on methods and data as above.\\nNote: Standard errors in parentheses, *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1\\n\\nCoefficient\\n\\n1.353%\"\\n(0.066)\\n0.688***\\n(0.041)\\n-12.7148**\\n(0.414)\\n4,712\\n188\\n\\n30\\n\\x0cMigration and Development Brief 32\\n\\nannual and quarterly remittance flows. Many\\ncountries are starting to use a new notion of\\nremittances introduced in the sixth edition of\\nthe IMF\\'s Balance of Payments and Interna-\\ntional Investment Position Manual (BPM6)\\n(IMF 2009). According to the new definition,\\npersonal remittances are the sum of two main\\ncomponents: “compensation of employees”\\nand \"personal transfers.” Secondary sourc-\\n\\nes of remittance data are the websites of\\ncountries’ central banks or statistical offices,\\nwhich provide high-frequency (monthly and/\\nor quarterly) data on one or both of the above\\ntwo categories. An extended discussion of\\ndata on migration and remittances is provided\\nin the Migration and Remittances Factbook\\n2016 and Migration and Development Brief 28\\n(World Bank 2016 and 2017). Gross domestic\\nproduct (GDP) forecasts were based on those\\nfrom World Bank\\'s World Development Indi-\\ncators data, augmented by growth rates from\\nthe IMF World Economic Outlook, World Bank\\nregional forecasts, Consensus Economics, Citi-\\nbank, Deutsche Bank, Institute of International\\nFinance, and JPMorgan Chase.*° The source\\nof data for monitoring the cost of sending\\nremittances through regulated channels is the\\nRemittance Prices Worldwide database.\\n\\nA.4 Caveats\\n\\nSome countries do not report data on remit-\\ntances in the IMF Balance of Payment statis-\\ntics. Several low- and middle-income countries\\n(LMICs)—for example, Cuba, Turkmenistan,\\nand Uzbekistan—do not report remittance\\ninflows data to the IMF, although it is known\\nthat emigration from those countries takes\\nplace. Some high-income countries (such as\\n\\nthe United Arab Emirates) do not report data\\non remittance outflows, although the countries\\nare important destinations for migrants. Some\\ncountries, such as China, have gaps in data\\nfollowing the transition from BPM5 to BPM6.\\nPast data and some current trends are used to\\narrive at estimates in such cases.\\n\\nA.5 Methodology for Forecasting For-\\neign Direct Investment\\n\\nThe foreign direct investment (FDI) projec-\\ntion model used in this report is derived from\\neconometric methods used earlier in the World\\nBank\\'s Global Development Finance publi-\\ncations (World Bank 2004). The dependent\\nvariable is the log of the FDI to nominal GDP\\nratio. Explanatory variables are the three-year\\nmoving average of the nominal GDP growth\\nrate of the top 30 major suppliers of FDI\\nweighted by the share of FDI; the lagged dif-\\nference between the nominal GDP growth rate\\nof the receiving LMIC and that of the top 30\\nmajor suppliers of FDI weighted by the share of\\nFDI (three-year moving average); the lagged\\nexports of goods and services to nominal GDP\\nratio of the receiving LMIC; the U.S. 10-year\\nT-bill rate; the lagged dependent variable;\\n\\nthe price of oil to capture oil-related FDI; and\\na dummy each for the impacts of the global\\nfinancial crisis (year 2009) and the Asian crisis\\n(year 1997). The model uses a panel of 114\\nLMICs over the period 1990-2019. Data are\\nfrom the World Bank\\'s World Development\\nIndicators. A panel random effects estimator is\\nused. The estimates give a respectable good-\\nness of fit (overall R-square = 0.58), and all ex-\\nplanatory variables are statistically significant.\\n\\x0cCOVID-19 Crisis Through a Migration Lens\\n\\nForward-looking estimates of explanatory\\nvariables used for projections are based on the\\nlatest available estimates from major invest-\\nment banks and international agencies. Export\\ngrowth is assumed to go down by 30 percent\\nfor year 2020 as per the World Trade Organi-\\nzation (WTO) estimates. GDP forecasts were\\nbased on those from the World Bank\\'s World\\nDevelopment Indicators data, augmented by\\ngrowth rates from IMF’s World Economic Out-\\nlook, World Bank regional forecasts, Consen-\\n\\nsus Economics, Citibank, Deutsche Bank, IIF,\\nand JPMorgan Chase.*! Crude oil prices (aver-\\nage of Brent, Dubai, and WTI), were projected\\nbased on the World Bank\\'s (2006) Global Eco-\\nnomic Prospects’ annual growth forecasts, and\\nthe T-bill average rate of early April 2020 was\\nassumed to be the average for the whole year\\nof 2020.

Internal migrants, however, are losing jobs\\nand livelihood in urban centers and returning home in\\nlarge numbers.\\n\\n*Remittances as share of GDP were 6.4 percent in\\n2019 in middle-income countries.\\n\\n“See Peoplemove blog (Ratha et al. 2019).\\n\\n°As of April 15, 2020, the euro was down 8 percent\\nagainst the U.S. dollar and the ruble was down by 16\\npercent.\\n\\nThe projections for portfolio flows are based on IIF\\nprojections.\\n\\n’The objective of SDG indicator 10.7.1 is to monitor\\nthe burden of costs incurred by migrant workers\\n\\nin obtaining jobs abroad. The World Bank and\\n\\nthe International Labour Organization (ILO) are\\nco-custodians of this indicator. A newly released\\n\\nILO report (2020) finds that migrant workers from\\nCambodia, Myanmar, and Lao PDR pay on average\\nthe equivalent of 2.3, 1.4, and 2.5 times, respectively,\\nof their monthly foreign earnings to secure a job in\\nThailand. Several countries are piloting recruitment\\ncost surveys, namely Ghana, Bangladesh, and\\nIndonesia, while Cambodia\\'s Labor Force Survey for\\n2019 included a module on recruitment costs for the\\nfirst time.\\n\\n®Data from the World Bank\\'s Remittance Prices\\nWorldwide database. In 2019 Q4, the Global Smart\\nRemitter Target (SmaRT) Average was recorded at\\n4.37 percent, down nearly 0.19 percentage points\\nfrom a year earlier. SmarRT is aimed to reflect the\\ncost that a savvy customer with access to sufficiently\\ncomplete information could pay to transfer remit-\\ntances in each corridor.\\n\\n°These cost data are simple averages of costs in spe-\\ncific corridors. The weighted average of costs (using\\nremittance volumes from the World Bank\\'s coun-\\ntry-level, bilateral remittances matrix as weights)\\nwas just over 5 percent in 2020 Q1, closer to the 5X5\\nremittance cost objective set by G20 in 2009.\\n\\n19On April 1, 2020, the Financial Action Task Force\\n(FATF) called for “continued implementation of the\\nFATF Standards to facilitate integrity and security\\nof the global payments system during and after\\nthe pandemic through legitimate and transparent\\nchannels with appropriate levels of risk-based due\\ndiligence.”\\n\\n\"On April 1, 2020, the Financial Action Task Force\\n(FATF) called for “continued implementation of the\\nFATF Standards to facilitate integrity and security\\nof the global payments system during and after\\nthe pandemic through legitimate and transparent\\nchannels with appropriate levels of risk-based due\\ndiligence.”\\n\\nAlso, digital channels are favored because of\\navoidance of the usage of cash.\\n\\n13An economic migrant is defined as an individual\\nwho: has moved from his/her country of birth or\\nusual residence to the host country for employment\\npurposes, is 18 years or older and is residing in the\\nhost country, and currently holds a work permit/\\nwork visa that allows him/her to be employed in the\\nhost country for 1 year or more with the possibility of\\nrenewal. It does not include students, seasonal work-\\ners, or individuals traveling for business purposes;\\nanyone who is considered a temporary resident and\\nnot a permanent resident; and anyone who is either\\ncurrently employed in the host country or looking for\\na job while residing in the host country.\\n\\n14In many countries, as long as migrants contribute\\nto the social security system of a host country or pay\\ngeneral taxes, they will be able to participate in the\\npublic health care system.\\n\\n\\'Still, employers are not legally obliged to provide\\nhealth care protection to foreign workers.\\n\\x0cCOVID-19 Crisis Through a Migration Lens\\n\\n16For example, the average total cost of sending\\n$200 from the United States to Mexico decreased\\nfrom 4.04 percent to 3.85 percent in April after mea-\\nsures related to the COVID-19 crisis.\\n\\nSaudi Arabia has exempted Filipinos working in\\nhealth care in the country from the travel ban.\\n\\n18The MOFA plans to reallocate Rupiah 100 billion\\n(about US$ 6.1 million) from its 2020 budget towards\\nemergency shelters and staple food deliveries for its\\ncitizens abroad.\\n\\nCentral Bank of Indonesia data (Table 30).\\n\\n?°lrregular migrant arrivals to Spain in 2018 surged\\nby 130 percent to 65,600, but this number fell sharply\\nto 32,500 in 2019, aided by increased cooperation\\nfrom the Moroccan government.\\n\\n2\\\\The economic situation in Argentina and Brazil\\ndampened outward remittances to Bolivia, Para-\\nguay, and Uruguay. Remittance flows from Argen-\\ntina to Bolivia decreased by 41 percent during the\\nfirst seven months of 2019, and those to Paraguay\\ndecreased by 36 percent during January-November\\n2019.\\n\\nThe numbers showed a decline in food services and\\nbars (-417,000), retail trade (-46,000), construc-\\ntion (-29,0000), hospitality (-29,000), health care\\n(-61,000), childcare services (-19,000), temporary\\nhelp services (-52,000), and personal and laundry\\nservices (-13,000).\\n\\n23See: https://www.chicagotribune.com/corona-\\nvirus/ct-nw-coronavirus-job-lo ederal-re-\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nport-20200403-cut4xnhiffeinkfbr\\n\\nhtml?int=lat_digitaladshouse_bx-modal_acaquisi-\\n\\noaxuaxgj2m-stor\\n\\n \\n\\ntion-subscriber_nqux_display-ad-interstitial_bx-bo-\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n*4Egypt is projected to see around -21.5 percent\\ngrowth in 2020 compared with 5 percent in 2019;\\nLebanon, to see -17 percent in 2020 from around\\n7 percent in 2019; and Jordan to see -22 percent in\\n2020 from around 1 percent in 2019.\\n\\n     \\n  \\n\\n25UNHCR database: hitps://www.unhcr.org\\n\\ndata.html.\\n\\nen-us\\n\\n    \\n\\n26World Bank (2020), Africa’s Pulse, No. 21, Spring\\n2020: An Analysis of Issues Shaping Africa\\'s Eco-\\nnomic Future.\\n\\n27No recent data were published in 2019 Q3 and\\n2019 Q4.\\n\\n28The top five countries hosting most displaced\\npersons, IDPs, and refugees combined include\\n\\nthe Democratic Republic of Congo (4.33 million);\\nEthiopia (3.4 million); Sudan (2.95 million); Somalia\\n(2.65 million); Nigeria (2.61 million); South Sudan\\n(1.96 million); Cameroon (1.39 million); Uganda (1.2\\nmillion); Burkina Faso (805,000); and the Central\\nAfrican Republic (690,000) (data from UNHCR and\\nIMO [2020)).\\n\\nThe link is positive if remittances adjust to the price\\nand income levels of the origin country to reflect the\\nneeds of remittance beneficiaries; in other words,\\ncountries with lower income would receive less\\nremittances and vice versa. The relationship may be\\nnegative if remittances are countercyclical, that is,\\nremittances increase if the economy of the country of\\norigin is adversely impacted.\\n\\n30For real GDP forecasts of 2020 and 2021, the low-\\ncase ones were used among market-sourced fore-\\ncasts, including those from Consensus Economics,\\nCitibank, Deutsche Bank, IIF, and JPMorgan Chase.\\nOur baseline scenario assumes that the impact of\\nCOVID-19 on global growth will be worse than of\\nthe 2008 financial crisis, and a meaningful rebound\\nin growth won\\'t take place until the first half of 2020.\\nTo calculate the nominal GDP vector for 2020 and\\n2021, real GDP growth forecasts were combined with\\nthe foreign-exchange vector (local currency versus\\nthe U.S. dollar) between December 2019 and March\\n2020 to reflect valuation effects and 2021 Consumer\\nPrice Index forecasts. For countries where GDP fore-\\ncasts were not available from multiple sources, the\\n2009 growth figure was used as a basis. For countries\\nwhere the 2009 growth was positive, however, the\\nnominal GDP vector was set as no growth. Popu-\\nlation growth rates from the World Development\\nIndicators were used to arrive at nominal per capita\\n\\nincomes.\\n\\n“Ibid.\\n\\n36\\n\\x0cMigration and Development Brief 32\\n\\nar\\n\\x0cCOVID-19 Crisis Through a Migration Lens\\n\\x0c+\\n\\nCasa BANK GROUP Ty\\n\\x0c']}\n"
