      "although different alternatives to measure city competitiveness have been explored in the literature (see for example porter (1990), faberberg (1996), boltho (1996), world bankl (2016)), we choose to look at firm productivity\n",
      "our decision is motivated by two arguments\n",
      "first, firms that are more productive, tend to locate in an environment where they can maximize profits\n",
      "to achieve this, they seek to hire the best, most productive workers as well as to have access to high quality infrastructure, amenities and services (gottlieb, 1994; frenkel, 2001)\n",
      "more productive firms will then tend to cluster in cities that provide such workers and offer a bundle of high-quality services\n",
      "second, cities that offer a good quality of life will be better positioned to attract firms and qualified workers\n",
      "since good quality of life and the standard of living is determined by the productivity of an economy, then productivity defines competitiveness (porter, 2000, p.19)\n",
      "porter’s argument stresses that cities cannot become more productive and competitive unless firms become more productive\n",
      "high city gdp, employment, and productivity (the three measures of competitive highlighted by the world bank report, 2016) are actually a consequence of how well firms perform\n",
      "this close relationship between city performance and firm performance provides the foundation for our focus on firm productivity as a good proxy for assessing and measuring a city’s competitiveness\n",
      "      between 2000 and today, african economies have strengthened their position in the global economy, showing average growth rates of 5.9 between 2000 and 2008 (world economic forum 2009), and 5.2 in the last 10 years\n",
      "2 furthermore, not only per capita gdp is growing, but also total factor productivity shows an average positive growth rates of just above 1% for the first time since the 1970s (rodrik 2016)\n",
      "3 at the same time, air pollution has climbed to dangerous levels, increasing annual deaths by 36 percent between 1990 and 2013 (roy 2016)\n",
      "4 while some 2   based on national gdp growth from oxford economics dataset\n",
      "3   even though there is some heterogeneity across the continent, the growth in total factor productivity ranges between 0.5% for the east region and 2% for the southern region (with the exception of the north region that shows a negative total factor productivity growth rate of -0.5%)\n",
      "4   as mentioned in roy (2016), “…the information gaps in regard to air pollution in africa, resulting from the absence of regulation and the regular monitoring that it entails, are significantly larger than is the case elsewhere (see inter alia knippertz et al., 2015 and evans, 2015)\n",
      "thus, there are no emissions inventories for african cities…”\n",
      "moreover,                                                                                                                       2   literature exists on the determinants of firm productivity for some african countries, to the best of our knowledge there is not comprehensive study that compares such determinants across regions, and none that links productivity at the firm level with air pollution measures for a sample of firms that spans all continents and regions\n",
      "what are the key determinants of firm productivity in africa and how do they compare to the rest of the world? are there any links between firm productivity and air pollution?       to shed light on these questions, we choose to focus on exploring the links between two sets of variables that may affect firm productivity: a group of business environment characteristics and air pollution\n",
      "business environment has been identified as one of the key factors that contribute to development (stern 2002, world bank 2005, world bank 2010)\n",
      "it provides the framework where firms interact, trade, and compete\n",
      "it includes not only the basic legal structure, but also other city characteristics that can affect firms’ performance, such as human capital or agglomeration economies.5 the same firm in a different environment will probably experience different challenges that can affect its productivity levels and outcomes\n",
      "      air pollution has also been considered an important factor affecting workers and firms through two main channels\n",
      "on the one hand, pollution levels can affect workers’ health and productivity\n",
      "recent studies on the effects of air pollution on worker productivity have quantified the negative effects on different production sectors (graff-zivin and neidell 2012, t\n"

      "second, it contributes to the pollution literature by focusing on air pollution as another possible determinant of firm productivity and exploring whether its relationship with african firm performance is different, compared to the rest of the world\n",
      "although the link between pollution and productivity is well established (see kahn et al\n",
      "(2017) for a survey on this topic), this paper focuses on africa and how air pollution is correlated to worker and firm productivity in that region\n",
      "     following reyes et\n",
      "al (2017), we use the world bank enterprise survey dataset\n",
      "we distinguish three different classifications for business environment (be): basic be, refined be, and agglomeration environment\n",
      "basic be is likely essential for facilitating firm growth\n",
      "it consists of basic protection (corruption, basic property rights protection, and basic physical safety), infrastructure (power supply and modern telecom), human capital, and access to finance (such as bank finance and trade credit)\n",
      "refined be covers other be elements that have been frequently mentioned in the literature, but perhaps less frequently mentioned than basic be\n",
      "it includes topics such as barriers to entry and exit (such as access to land), labor regulations, tax burdens\n",
      "the agglomeration environment is a new category that has not been emphasized in the literature, but recent papers find important for explaining firm performance across the world (clarke, li and xu 2017)\n",
      "it incorporates whether or not a firm is located in a large city, the extent to which a firm is surrounded by “capable firms”, measured as the share of firms whose number of employees exceeds 50 (capacity agglomeration), and whether the firm competes with firms on the informal sector (informal competition)\n",
      "     when looking at air pollution, we focus on measures of particulate matter\n",
      "even though many pollutants contribute to contaminate the air, particulate matter is the one that affects human health the most\n",
      "in particular, small particles, those with a diameter of 2.5 microns or less, are the most dangerous because they can travel the blood stream and sit into the lungs, producing long lasting health consequences\n",

      "(2017): employment growth and labor productivity growth\n",
      "employment growth corresponds to the one-year employment change, and labor productivity is measured as sales over the number of permanent employees\n",
      "          our findings can be summarized in two main points\n",
      "frist, among the business environment variables, capacity agglomeration is the only variable that shows a different effect for african firms\n",
      "capacity agglomeration (the share of firms with at least 50 employees) has a stronger positive effect in this region, increasing labor productivity growth\n",
      "second, concentration levels of pm 2.5 also have a distinct effect for african firms\n",
      "the relationship between pollution and firm performance goes through three stages: negative, positive, and negative again (cubic relationship between pm 2.5 and labor productivity growth)\n",
      "although, as expected, we find a range of pollution levels where the correlation with productivity is positive, it is interesting to see that pollution effects turn negative at considerably low levels of pm 2.5 (approximately 30 𝜇𝜇𝜇𝜇/𝑚𝑚3)\n",
      "       the rest of the paper is structured as follows\n",
      "section two describes the data and methodology\n",
