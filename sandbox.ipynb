      "\n",
      "Bankl  (2016)),  we  choose  to  look  at  firm  productivity.  Our  decision  is  motivated  by  two \n",
      "\n",
      "arguments. First, firms that are more productive, tend to locate in an environment where they \n",
      "\n",
      "can maximize profits. To achieve this, they seek to hire the best, most productive workers as well \n",
      "\n",
      "as to have access to high quality infrastructure, amenities and services (Gottlieb, 1994; Frenkel, \n",
      "\n",
      "2001). More productive firms will then tend to cluster in cities that provide such workers and \n",
      "\n",
      "offer a bundle of high-quality services. Second, Cities that offer a good quality of life will be better \n",
      "\n",
      "positioned to attract firms and qualified workers. Since good quality of life and the standard of \n",
      "\n",
      "living \n",
      "\n",
      "is  determined  by  the  productivity  of  an  economy,  then  productivity  defines \n",
      "\n",
      "competitiveness (Porter, 2000, p.19). Porter’s argument stresses that cities cannot become more \n",
      "\n",
      "productive and competitive unless firms become more productive. High city GDP, employment, \n",
      "\n",
      "and productivity (the three measures of competitive highlighted by the World Bank Report, 2016) \n",
      "\n",
      "are  actually  a  consequence  of  how  well  firms  perform.  This  close  relationship  between  city \n",
