This is a ten-fold increase in measures since the first edition of this living paper (March 20). New countries include Angola, Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Aruba, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Belarus, Bermuda, Brunei, Chad, Grenada, Libya, Montserrat, Nigeria, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Seychelles, St Maarten, and UAE. Social assistance transfers are the most widely used class of interventions (60 percent of global responses, or 412 measures). These are complemented by significant action in social insurance and labor market-related measures (supply-side measures). Among safety nets, cash transfer programs remain the most widely used safety net intervention by governments (table 1 and figure 2). Overall, cash transfers include 222 COVID-related measures representing one-third (32.4 percent) of total COVID-related social protection programs. Cash transfers include a mix of both new and pre-existing programs of various duration and generosity. About half (47 percent) of cash transfers are new programs in 78 countries (reaching 512.6 million people), while one-fifth (22 percent) of measures are one-off payments. The average duration of transfers is 2.9 months. The size of transfers is relatively generous, or one-fifth (22 percent) of monthly GDP per capita in respective countries. On average, this is an increase of 86.6 percent compared to average pre-COVID transfer levels (where data is available for a subset of countries).', 'abstract_views': '7,250', 'file_downloads': '5,363', 'published_date': '2020-04-17', 'pdf_link': 'https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/33635/Social-Protection-and-Jobs-Responses-to-COVID-19-A-Real-Time-Review-of-Country-Measures.pdf?sequence=17&isAllowed=y', 'collection': 'Knowledge Notes', 'numb_pages': 502, 'full_text': 'Public Disclosure Authorized\\n\\nPublic Disclosure Authorized\\n\\nSocial Protection and Jobs Responses to COVID-19:\\nA Real-Time Review of Country Measures\\n\\n“Living paper” version 12 (July 10, 2020)\\n\\nUgo Gentilini (WB), Mohamed Almenfi (WB), Pamela Dale (UNICEF), Ana Veronica Lopez (WB),\\nand Usama Zafar (WB)\\n\\nThis paper benefited enormously from contributions by Miglena Abels, Aysenur Acar, Hanan Ahli, Nazanin Akhgar, Haleem Hassan\\nKashkol Al-Kazali, Amel Allahoum, Andrew Allieu, Sulaiman Al Maazmi, Noora Al Qassi, Elena Andreeva, Colin Andrews, Edward\\nArchibald, Temilade Aromolaran, Jehan Arulpragasam, Angela Elzir Assy, Ashiq Aziz, Indra Baatarkhuu, Reena Badiani-Magnusson,\\nYusuf Bafozoda, Sarah Bailey, Paul Bance, Anna Baranova, Mehdi Barouni, Roland Berenger Berehoudougou, Martina Bergthaller,\\nAnush Bezhanyan, Sharon Corinne Benzoni, Mira Bierbaum, Gaston Mariano Blanco, Mark Blecher, Christian Bodewig, , Stefanie\\nBrodmann, Hugo Brousset Chaman, Dimitriy Bychkov, Yoonyoung Cho, Tungalag Chuluun, Francesca Ciardi, Emmanuelle Collet,\\nFacundo Cuevas, Matthew Cummins, Pamela Dale, James Damon, Louise Moreira Daniel, Marie-Christina Dankmeyer, Benedicte\\nLeroy De La Briere, Gustavo Demarco, Anastasiya Denisova, Malin Linnea Sofia Ed, Randa El-Rashidi, Gerardo Escaroz, Fatou Fall,\\nMaliha Fanning, Olesia Feoktistova, Katharina Maria Fietz, Gabrielle Fox, Nicholas Freeland, Luis Frota, Carlos Galian, Jordi Jose\\nGallego-Ayala, Maria Concepcion Steta Gandara, Elena Glinskaya, Elisaveta Gouretskaia, Rebekka Grun, Sabina Guliyeva, Sibusiso\\nGumbi, Melis Guven, Courtney Hallink, Mahdi Halmi, Siddharth Hari, Gonzalo Javier Reyes Hartley, Abu Yadetta Hateu, Alessandra\\nHeinemann, Himanshi Jain, Johannes Hoenigl, Maddalena Honorati, Armenuhi Hovakimyan, Su Su Htay, Roberto Iacono, Adina-Maria\\nIorganda, Kumiko Imai, Adina-Maria lorganda, Buthaina al-Iryani, Aylin Isik-Dikmelik, Marijana Jasarevic, Mustafa Kadhim\\nMohammed, Amjad Zafar Khan, Alex Kamurase, Sandor Karacsony, Dmitri Karasyov, Selma Kasic, Yasuhiro Kawasoe, Ayaba\\nGilberte Kedote, Qaiser Khan, Johannes Koettl, Julian Alexander Koschorke, Mona Korsgard, Adea Kryeziu, Francesca Lamanna,\\nMaria Laura, Aleksandar Lazovski, Matthieu Lefebvre, Kook Hee Lee, Phillippe George Leite, Louisa Lippi, Christina Lowe, Mattias\\nLundberg, Mattia Makovic, Iftikhar Malik, Alicia C.

The latter includes an additional 31 interventions compared to version 11 of this review\\n(figure 1, left hand graph). Such growth is remarkable.

A total of 638 measures were recorded,\\naccounting for 60% of the response. Nearly 50% of those safety net measures, and about 30% of global measures,\\nare various forms of cash-based transfers. Besides 298 cash transfer programs in 139 countries (6 of which\\nuniversal transfers), a robust number (25) of social pension schemes is implemented in 22 countries (table 1). In-\\nkind transfers are also substantial, with 22% of the social assistance portfolio including the distribution of food\\ncommodities, vouchers and school feeding programs. Both in-kind transfers and cash have bene growing steadily\\nover time. Finally, 15 public work programs, a modality largely discontinued or amended in the early phases of\\nthe pandemic, are now present in 12 countries.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nTable 1.

A total of 62 programs in 47 countries have\\nsimplified and made their administrative systems more user-friendly. This includes making it easier for people to\\naccess programs, provide advance payments, waiving conditionalities, allow for remote applications, etc. More\\ngenerous transfers are provided for 78 programs in 58 countries, both in terms of higher transfer levels and extra\\npayment cycles. Scale-up of program coverage is occurring in 165 countries and concerns 479 measures. Among\\nthem, existing programs are being scaled-up in 26 cases. A total of 454 programs are new (71% of social\\nassistance), 79 of which are one-off measures (12% of the total). Table 2 and figure 3 report those adaptations.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nPRU a CEE Tas N. of programs __N. of cour\\nIncrease in existing benefits 78 58\\nVertical expansion 54 39\\nAdditional payment 24 27\\nScale up coverage 479 165\\nExisting programs 26 21\\nNew programs 454 165\\none-off (targeted) 74 41\\none-of (universal) 5 5\\nnon-one off (universal) 1 1\\nnon-one off (targeted) 374 156\\nBoth vertical and horizontal expansion 18 14\\nAdministration 62 47\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nOver a billion individuals benefitted from social assistance in various ways. Based on our analysis, 4 sets of\\nnumbers can be considered: if we consider the full set of ways in which programs are adapted (i.e., administration,\\n\\n3\\n\\x0cadequacy and coverage), these have benefitted 1.8 billion people (1,801,343,016). If we examine the sole metric\\nof horizontal coverage expansion for cash transfers, then such scale-up covered almost 1.1 billion people\\n(1,080,686,828). This is 14% of the world’s population (see figure 3 for a breakdown by country Covid coverage\\nrates). This level would increase by about half a billion people, or totaling 1.6 billion, if also in-kind transfers are\\nincluded (1,611,029,017).\\n\\nInformal sector workers are one of the main populations targeted with cash transfers. We estimate that\\n136.7 million such workers are reached by cash-based programs (table 3). This is likely a conservative estimate,\\nwith countries announcing the intention to reach informal workers but not systematically reporting coverage\\nnumbers. Countries with higher rates of coverage include Philippines and El Salvador, while in absolute terms\\nArgentina and Colombia show overage of 9 and 10 million, respectively. Morocco’s reach of 3 million informal\\nworkers — the program that taps the health sector database (Ramed) documented more in detail in May’s editions\\nfeaturing delivery practices — is also remarkable.\\n\\nInformal sector\\n\\nTable 3.

To explore this question, we use\\nadministrative data from the ASPIRE database for 57 countries. For 14 of them, coverage started from very low\\nlevels, with resulting scale up for a factor of 10 and beyond”. If we exclude those exceptional cases, for the\\nremaining sample of 43 cases the average rate of increase in cash transfers coverage is about 244% (see figure 5).\\nNote that baseline data should be taken as an upper bound estimate since administrative data tends to overestimate\\nrates due to possible program overlaps (see annex | for pre-Covid rates).\\n\\n\\' The Stringency Index is a composite measure based on nine response indicators including school closures, workplace closures, and\\ntravel bans, rescaled to a value from 0 to 100 (100 = strictest response). Since the index evolves over time, we considered the average\\nvalue since it was non-zero to July 10 (source: Our World in Data).\\n? Namely Angola, Lao PDR, Togo, Myanmar, Zimbabwe, Congo Dem.

Our preliminary\\nestimates indicate that planned or actual cash transfers reach 22% of the sample of 57 countries with ASPIRE\\nadministrative data pre-Covid. These are “on top” of pre-existing cash transfers which reach 16% of the\\npopulation. Combined, the pre and Covid coverage equals to an average of 38% of the population in those\\ncountries. These range from between 60-70% in East Asia, Latin America and high-income countries to less than\\n20% in Africa, MENA and low-income settings.\\n\\x0cFigure 6.

This is an important\\nquestion to get a firmer grip at country level action. While reporting is often limited, patchy and unavailable, we\\nre-surveyed the universe of social assistance measures with a view of understanding their ‘state in\\nimplementation’ (table 4). Information was available for about 31% of the sample, or 195 measures. Out of these,\\n72% (141 measures) are ongoing, while the rest of the portfolio is either planned (13%) or completed (14%) at\\nthis time. For instance, the reassessment revealed that some countries had announced measures which would be\\nsubsequently canceled: for example, Egypt had planned a cash transfers for 200,000 informal sector workers, but\\nthis was eventually reconsidered.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nTable 4.

This includes an additional 10 measure and 3 additional countries, bringing the count to 273 and 125,\\nrespectively. Most programs include unemployment benefits (79 measures), followed by paid sick leave (68) and\\nthe wavers, deferment or subsidization of social security contributions (61). Also significant is the number of\\n\\x0cpensions and disability-related measures (50), while healthcare insurance support only appeared in 15 cases.

With 144 programs\\nin 88 countries, this edition cements the role of wage subsidies as the lead labor instrument: those measure now\\naccount for 56% of the labor portfolio with 81 measures in 69 countries. Other measures include labor market\\nregulation adjustments (28 cases), 23 activation initiatives, and shorter-time arrangements (12).

Relative to last month, the broad\\ncomposition remains similar, with marginal changes in the order of one percentage point. Sub-Saharan Africa is\\nthe region with the highest share of social assistance (84%), followed by South Asia (76%) and Latin America\\nand the Caribbean (71%). North America as well as Europe and Central Asia display a higher reliance on social\\ninsurance, while East Asia present the largest share of labor market measures (e.g., with programs in Singapore,\\nChina, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Philippines). The latter as just 5% in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia (figure\\n7).\\nFigure 7.

Among these countries, 13 new measures were\\nincluded since June, and a few countries, notably Syria, are now actively introducing social protection measures.\\nBurundi, Central African Republic, Eritrea, Kiribati, Marshall Island and Yemen are the only countries for which\\nmeasures were not recorded.\\n\\nHow much are countries spending on social protection responses? For a subset of countries for which data is\\navailable (75 in the case of social assistance, 21 for insurance, and 17 for labor markets), a total of $589 billion\\nis being reported. This is line with the level reported in June and represents about 0.4% of the world’s $142 trillion\\nGDP. Such level of investment is comparable to the overall social protection spending that occurred as part of the\\nglobal response to the 2010 financial crisis (note that the Covid crisis may well be at the early stages, with potential\\nfor spending to soar remarkably). Per capita spending, however, is highly uneven: this ranges from $121 in high-\\nincome countries to a mere $1 in low-income settings; similarly, South Asia only provides $3/capita (Table 7).\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nTable 7.
